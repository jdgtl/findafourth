# PTI (Platform Tennis Index) Notes

## Scoring System
- **Lower PTI = Better player** (similar to golf handicap)
- **Higher PTI = More novice player**
- **Negative PTIs = Professional/elite level** (the "holy grail")

## Example Scale
- Negative PTI: Professional/elite players
- 0-20: Very strong players
- 20-40: Intermediate players
- 40+: Beginner/novice players

## Important
When displaying PTI comparisons or skill ranges, remember that lower numbers indicate higher skill level. This is the opposite of typical rating systems.
